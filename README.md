# kaiote
Web App developed by Kelvin Mwangi for the assignment given by the Kaiote Team to extract and graph randomly generated number from a device via LoRa

A Web Application was developed to solve the above problem. It captures the json data sent by the device and extract various objects and fields. It then stores these values in a MySQL database hosted in a remote server.

Data extraction
Base64 > HEX > TRUNCATED HEX > DECIMAL

All the above data is stored in the db after each conversion

The Web App also provides an interface to Graph this data.
